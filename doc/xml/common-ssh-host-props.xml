  <entry>This is the remote computer that is used to establish the SSH connection and from which the remote database server is reachable</entry>

  <entry>SSH Port</entry>
  <entry>The port for the SSH connection. If this is empty the default port 22 is used.</entry>

  <entry>Password</entry>
  <entry>
    <para>This is either the password for the remote user login, or, if a private key file is specified, the passphrase
    for that key file. If no password is provided, you will be prompted to enter one when connecting. </para>
    <para>If a password is entered, it is <emphasis role="bold">always</emphasis> stored in the profile.</para>
    <para>
      If no password is entered, you will be prompted for one when the connection is established. If the password
      is used as a passphrase for a private key file, the entered password will be remembered until the application is closed.
      It will be (re)used for other tunnels using the same private key file.

  <entry>Authenticate through SSH agent</entry>
  <entry>
    <para>
      If this option is enabled &wb-productname; will try to use a running SSH agent to authenticate
      against the SSH host. Supported agents are <literal>pageant.exe</literal> for Windows&reg; and <literal>ssh-agent</literal>
      for Linux systems. In this case supplying a private key file or a password is not necessary, but the user name is still required.
    </para>
    <para>
      In order to be able to communicate with the SSH agent, additional libraries are needed, which can be
      downloaded from <ulink url="https://www.sql-workbench.eu/jna.zip"/>. Please unzip the archive and
      put the two jar files into the <literal>ext</literal> sub-directory where <literal>sqlworkbench.jar</literal> is located.
